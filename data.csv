1907,100,10,"Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite, the first fully synthetic plastic, meaning it contained no molecules found in nature. Baekeland had been searching for a synthetic substitute for shellac, a natural electrical insulator, to meet the needs of the rapidly electrifying United States. Bakelite was not only a good insulator; it was also durable, heat resistant, and, unlike celluloid, ideally suited for mechanical mass production. Marketed as “the material of a thousand uses,” Bakelite could be shaped or molded into almost anything, providing endless possibilities."

1940,454,577,"Five days before Japan’s surprise attack, another group of farsighted pioneers met in Detroit, MI. These were salesmen who shared a spirit of friendly rivalry and companionship due to their mutual frustration in trying to sell the then-new and unproven plastics to skeptical automotive engineers. They enjoyed meeting and sharing technical information on plastic materials and processes. Out of these meetings grew the concept of a technical society with the purpose of distributing technical information that would allow the promotion of the plastics industry. In February 1942, they incorporated the Society of Plastics Sales Engineers. Later that year the name was changed to the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) to encompass a more diverse membership. During the war years, SPE promoted the development of standards and the distribution of technical information while helping to educate those who were manufacturing components for the military."

1942,476,636,"In 1944, a book titled “Plastic Horizons,” by B.H. Weil and Victor Anhorn, documented the promise of plastic. A chapter titled “Plastics in a World at War” opens with a paean to the blood toll of war. But then the authors trace how war bends science to its needs for new both deadly and life-saving items: Physicists turn to aircraft detection, chemists to explosives. “Nylon for stockings has become nylon for parachutes. Rubber for tires has almost vanished, and desperate measures are required to replace it with man-made elastics.” That section concludes, “Plastics have indeed gone to war.”  “There may be no Plastics Age, but that should discourage no one; applications will multiply with the years,” they continued. “Plastics are indeed versatile materials, and industry, with the help of science, will continue to add to their number and to improve their properties. Justifiable optimism is the order of the day, and the return of peace will enable the plastics industry to fulfill its promise of things to come.”"
1943,488,667,"After the war, chronic shortages of common materials like rubber, cork, linseed oil, and paints forced chemists to scramble for substitutes, further speeding the embrace of plastics.

1948,548,842,"The iconic Eames' armchair is injection moulded for the first time. This armchair is from Charles and Ray Eames's legendary Plastic Shell Group, which was without doubt the most revolutionary seating programme of all time. The Eameses developed their Plastic Shell Group in collaboration with Herman Miller, Zenith Plastics, and the engineering department of the University of California, Los Angeles. This project was based on the concept of a universal, single-form seat shell (with arms and without) that could be used with a variety of interchangeable bases to provide numerous variations. Introduced by Herman Miller in 1950, this seating group - including the DAW - is amongst the most influential in the history of furniture, not only because it was the very first to be mass-produced in plastic but also because it introduced the concept of an integrated seating system."

More than any other company or device, Bic’s Cristal pen came to define the pen as an easily replaceable commodity, meaning that if there was a problem with the pen you were using, it was simply easier to get a hold of another pen than it would be to fix the pen that wasn’t working."
