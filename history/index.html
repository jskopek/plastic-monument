    <h1>A history of plastic</h1>

    <h2>1952</h2>



    <p>The Bic Ballpoint Pen: Marcel Bich, a French industrialist who had deep knowledge of the pen industry, bought out
        Biro’s patent in the early 1950s, a move that proved brilliant, because Bich’s company, Bic, was masterful at
        producing disposable devices at an incredibly low price point. More than any other company or device, Bic’s
        Cristal pen came to define the pen as an easily replaceable commodity, meaning that if there was a problem with
        the pen you were using, it was simply easier to get a hold of another pen than it would be to fix the pen that
        wasn’t working.</p>



    <h2>1953</h2>



    <p>In August 1955, LIFE magazine published an article with the now-vaguely-sinister, then-celebratory title,
        “Throwaway Living.”</p>



    <h2>1955</h2>



    <p>Italian firm Montecatini begin large-scale commercial production of isotactic polypropylene.</p>



    <h2>1957</h2>



    <p>First plastic credit card: American Express charge card, which required payments in full at the end of the month.
        PVC plastic soon replaced the cardboard or thin, paperlike celluloid used in its contemporaries.</p>



    <h2>1958</h2>



    <p>High-density polyethylene bottles introduced and begin to replace glass bottles in most applications</p>



    <h2>1961</h2>



    <p>Disposible razor and cartridge razor was invented by American entertainer and inventor Paul Winchell</p>



    <h2>1963</h2>



    <p>1965 – Chemist Stephanie Kwolek develops light, extremely resistive and durable plastic compound that is today
        known under the name of Kevlar. Today, this plastic is used by military and police in bullet resistive
        protective wear.</p>



    <h2>1965</h2>



    <p>In The Graduate, one of the top movies of 1968, Dustin Hoffman’s character was urged by an older acquaintance to
        make a career in plastics. Audiences cringed along with Hoffman at what they saw as misplaced enthusiasm for an
        industry that, rather than being full of possibilities, was a symbol of cheap conformity and superficiality.</p>



    <h2>1968</h2>



    <p>Bic brings lighters and razors to its’ lineup of ultra-cheap, disposable alternatives to expensive products.</p>



    <h2>1969</h2>



    <p>An organization called Pollution Probe was formed in 1969 by students and faculty at the University of Toronto
        and in 1971, members published a report stressing the need for recycling</p>



    <h2>1971</h2>



    <p>The PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottle was created.</p>



    <h2>1973</h2>



    <p>Rubik’s cube invented and patented in Hungary. Erno Rubik, a Hungarian architect, wanted a working model to help
        explain three-dimensional geometry.</p>



    <h2>1975</h2>



    <p>Is Five organized Canada’s first multi-material curbside pickup of recyclable material for 80,000 households of
        The Beaches neighbourhood of east Toronto. In 1977, Jack McGinnis and Derek Stephenson created a private
        consulting company, Resource Integration Systems (RIS) to advise governments in the field of recycling and waste
        management.</p>



    <h2>1976</h2>



    <p>Recyclable bottles: Coca‑Cola introduced the world to the two litre PET plastic bottle. It became popular for a
        lot of reasons: it doesn’t break; it’s re-sealable, lightweight and recyclable.</p>



    <h2>1978</h2>



    <p>Polyester film stock replaces cellulose acetate for photographic film and computer tapes.</p>



    <h2>1980</h2>



    <p>The Dixie Bag Company, along with similar firms such as Houston Poly Bag and Capitol Poly, was instrumental in
        the manufacturing, marketing and perfecting of plastic bags in the 1980s. Kroger, a Cincinnati-based grocery
        chain, began to replace its paper shopping bags with plastic bags in 1982,[7] and was soon followed by its
        rival, Safeway.[7]</p>



    <h2>1985</h2>



    <p>A barge of trash from NYC takes an Atlantic Cruise, getting turned away by North Carolina, Belize, Bahamas and 5
        other states before returning to Brooklyn. Harrelson refused to say how much the Mobro’s 6,000-mile voyage to
        nowhere had cost him. The price tag was believed to be nearly $1 million. The press focused America’s attention
        on the growing national problem of solid waste management, encouraged an expansion of recycling programs and
        brought pressure on Congress to the pass the 1990 Clean Air/Clean Water Act.</p>



    <h2>1986</h2>



    <p>First polymer bank notes issued in Australia</p>



    <h2>1988</h2>



    <p>3D Printing begins: 3D Systems (Charles Hull’s company) created the world’s first stereolithographic apparatus
        (SLA) machine, which made it possible to fabricate complex parts, layer by layer, in a fraction of the time it
        would normally take. That same year, startup DTM produced the world’s first selective laser sintering (SLS)
        machine—which shoots a laser at a powder instead of a liquid.</p>



    <h2>1991</h2>



    <p>Patagonia working with R&amp;D company Malden Mills, develop recycled polyester from PET bottles for use in our
        Synchilla fleece.</p>



    <h2>1995</h2>

        health and ecosystems.</p>



    <h2>2003</h2>



    <p>Open-source 3D printing: In 2005, Dr. Adrian Bowyer’s RepRap Project launched an open-source initiative to create
        a 3D printer that could basically build itself—or at least print most of its own parts. Its 2008 release,
        Darwin, is a self-replicating printer that’s able to do just that. Suddenly, people everywhere had the power to
        create whatever stuff they could dream up on their own (see also: Kickstarter, which launched in 2009 and has
        since crowdfunded countless 3D-printing-related projects).</p>



    <h2>2005</h2>



    <p>San Francisco becomes the first U.S. city to institute a plastic bag ban.</p>



    <h2>2006</h2>



    <p>A government study confirms that Bisphenol A, a chemical used to manufacture hard plastic bottles and the lining
        of baby-formula cans, may increase risks of early puberty, breast cancer, prostate issues and behavioral
        problems.</p>



    <h2>2007</h2>



    <p>only 13% of one trillion single-use plastic bags produced were recycled, the rest were thrown away, which means
        they end up in landfills and because they are so lightweight end up in the atmosphere blown into the
        environment.</p>



    <h2>2009</h2>



    <p>3D printing starts to reach mainstream</p>



    <h2>2010</h2>



    <p>Ocean Cleanup project first presented by Boyan Slat</p>



    <h2>2011</h2>



    <p>Precious Plastic launches first 4 small-scale plastic recycling machines to a community of local plastic
        craftspeople, the shredder, the extruder, the injection and the compression.</p>



    <h2>2012</h2>



    <p>The Netherlands becomes the first country to ban microbeads in cosmetics</p>



    <h2>2013</h2>



    <p>600 Billion LEGO parts produced</p>



    <h2>2014</h2>



    <p>Taylor et al. proved in 2016 that microplastics are already becoming integrated into deep-water organisms that
        live at depths between 300 and 1800 meters. All microplastics found in this study were microfibers4 . There is a
        considerable potential for large-scale accumulations of fibrous microscopic plastic debris5 .</p>



    <h2>2015</h2>



    <p>Kenya bans plastic bags, making it one the most recent of the more than two dozen countries that have sought to
        reduce plastic bag use through fees or bans.</p>

    <h2>2017</h2>



    <p>Ocean Cleanup launched first pilot in June, after years of development and testing.</p>



    <h2>2019</h2>



    <p>Banning harmful single-use plastics as early as 2021 under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and taking
        other steps to reduce plastic waste, where supported by scientific evidence and when warranted – and taking
        other steps to reduce plastic waste. The ban would reduce pollution from single-use plastic products and
        packaging – such as shopping bags, straws, cutlery, plates, and stir sticks</p>
